# Stoffel MPC Protocols
This repository contains robust MPC protocol implementations compatible with the [StoffelVM](https://github.com/Stoffel-Labs/StoffelVM) for use via the [Stoffel framework](https://github.com/Stoffel-Labs/Stoffel).
We are mainly concerned about robust MPC protocols. However, the traits implemented in this repository can be used for non-robust MPC protocols as well.
